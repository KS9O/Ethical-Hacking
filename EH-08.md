# Linux Privilege Escalation
## Table of Contents
1. Linux Local PE

# Linux Local PE
## Linux Boot Order
1. MBR = Master Boot Record
2. GRUB = Grand Unified Bootloader
3. Kernel = System core
4. Init = Root, first process
5. Run level = After boot
## GRUB, Grand Unified Boot Loader
- GRUB is the linux boot loader package
- Executed as part of the boot sequence
- Allows the user to choose which OS to load
## Local PE via GRUB
- Interrupt GRUB by pressing e or enter. enter edit mode by pressing E.
- Change: ro to rw and append init=/bin/bash at the end of the line
- boot the system by pressing crtl+x, a root level /bin/bash shell will load.
## Encrypting GRUB
- mitigation idea 
- grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 prompts and encrypts a new password
- configure the 40_custom to allow a specific user, set superusers="root" and prompt a password using password_pbkdf2 root [ hash ]
- grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
## Cracking Linux Hash via JTR
- Brute-forcing linux hashes can be done via John the Ripper ( JTR )
- use unshadow to combine passwd and shadow files
- results are saved in the /.john/john.pot hidden directory
# Linux Remote PE
## Known CVEs
- Common vulnerabilities and exposures
- pre-written code that exploits specific vulnerabilities
- used for privilege escalation
## Kernel Exploitation Flow
- System = Kernel Version
- ExploitDB = Finding matching CVE
- Remote Upload = upload to the system
- Compile = Compile the code file
- Execute = ./exploit
## DirtyCow Kernel Exploit
- An exploit that takes advantage of race condition
- allows writing to a file without the write privilege
- Download the dirtycow exploit from exploitDB
