# Fundamentals
## Intro
- Passwords = strings of character that are encrypted and use to authenticate digital resources
- Hashes = identifiers calculated by applying mathematical functions to given values
- Combinations = passwords and hashes are often used together to protect data
## Attack Methodologies
- Guessing Passwords
- Default Passwords
- Cracking
- Phishing
## Password Weaknesses
- Weak Passwords = easy-to-remember passwords are the first hackers will try
- Reused passwords = using the same password in multiple accounts
- Hash weakness = cracking old hash algorithms over time
## One-Way Functions
- a value is hashed by a hasing algorithm and can be compared for identification
- using two different algorithms for the hasing process will make the value harder to identify
## Hash Types
    - The main differences among the functions are the length of the resulting hash value and the parameters and process of each algorithm
- Hash             - Characteristics
- MD5 = 128-bit cryptographic hash, considered vulnerable since 2012
- SHA-1 = 160-bit cryptographic hash; Collision attack was performed in 2017
- SHA-256 = 256-bit cryptgraphic hash, used mainly in SSH and SSL
- NTLM = Re-encoded text hased w/ MD4, used in Windows OS
- NetNTLM = Improved version of NTLM, uses salting and time stamps against PTH
## Password Attack Types
- Dictionary
- Brute-Force
- Mutated Dictonary
- Rainbow Table
- RAR/ZIP cracking
## Defensive Measures
- Strong password = Complex and uncommon passowrds
- Login Attempt Limiation = Can prevent brute-force attacks
- fail2ban = examines system logs and failed login attempts and allows filtration
