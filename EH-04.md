# Fundamentals
## Intro
- Passwords = strings of character that are encrypted and use to authenticate digital resources
- Hashes = identifiers calculated by applying mathematical functions to given values
- Combinations = passwords and hashes are often used together to protect data
## Attack Methodologies
- Guessing Passwords
- Default Passwords
- Cracking
- Phishing
## Password Weaknesses
- Weak Passwords = easy-to-remember passwords are the first hackers will try
- Reused passwords = using the same password in multiple accounts
- Hash weakness = cracking old hash algorithms over time
## One-Way Functions
- a value is hashed by a hasing algorithm and can be compared for identification
- using two different algorithms for the hasing process will make the value harder to identify
## Hash Types
    - The main differences among the functions are the length of the resulting hash value and the parameters and process of each algorithm
- Hash             - Characteristics
- MD5 = 128-bit cryptographic hash, considered vulnerable since 2012
- SHA-1 = 160-bit cryptographic hash; Collision attack was performed in 2017
- SHA-256 = 256-bit cryptgraphic hash, used mainly in SSH and SSL
- NTLM = Re-encoded text hased w/ MD4, used in Windows OS
- NetNTLM = Improved version of NTLM, uses salting and time stamps against PTH
## Password Attack Types
- Dictionary
- Brute-Force
- Mutated Dictonary
- Rainbow Table
- RAR/ZIP cracking
## Defensive Measures
- Strong password = Complex and uncommon passowrds
- Login Attempt Limiation = Can prevent brute-force attacks
- fail2ban = examines system logs and failed login attempts and allows filtration
# Offline Password Cracking
## John
- a widely used linux tool for password cracking
- supports various attack options, including hybrid attacks
- supports hash types used in modern systems that can be automatically detected
![Alt text](<../assets/john password cracking.png>)
## John the Ripper
- John the Ripper was originally CPU-based
- John-Jumbo was created to allow GPU-based computations
- Jumbo is an improved version w/ support for many more hash types
## Rar2john
- Uses Brute-Force to crack RAR, PDF, and ZIP files
- It creates or uses a wordlist file for its cracking attempts
- Rar2john [filename] > hash.txt
- Zip2john [filename] > hash.txt
## HashCat
- Cross-platform tool claimed to be the fastest password-cracking utility
- Supports both CPU and GPU
- It supports approximately 210 different hash types and five attack modes
## Crunch 
- Password list generator that forms passwords based on length and charset
- Useful when partial knowledge of the victim has been obtained
- Can be used to generate lists of passwords according to templates
## Cup
- Creates a wordlist based on words victims may use
- Social engineering on the victim may help the attacker build the list
- The victim may use an easy-to-remember password based on personal information
# Online Password Attacks
## Online Cracking Services
- Common and weak paswords are listed in public databases
- Applications like CrackStation can examine lists of passwords in a matter of milliseconds
- Some password-recovery services can crack passwords using powerful, dedicated servers.
## Hydra
- A tool that supports many remote protocols and web format logins
- It continuously attacks while the server sends an access denied response.
- Hydra's basic flags include:
- -l [user name]
- -P [path to wordlist]
- [IP]:[Port]
## Medusa
- A thread-based remote authentication cracking tool
- Supports parallel connections
- Supports the same protocols as Hydra but operatoes more slowly
## Ncrack
- The fastest and most reliable tool for remote authentication
- Has built-in support for Nmap output formats and other advantages
