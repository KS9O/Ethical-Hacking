# Understanding Web Technologies
## OWASP
- Open Web Application Security Project
- non-profit organization
- provides application security information
- provides free to use environment
    - OWASP is an open community dedicated to exposing breaches and raising awareness
## OWASP Top 10
- a list of the most common web-related vulnerabilities
- Used as awareness tips when considering web application security
- Recommend as best practices when building a security framework
## Client Vs. Server
- Client Side = Operations that take place locally
- clients access web page content stored on servers
- Server Side = Operations that take place on a server
- DB management, resource distribution, etc.
    - Client and server communicate via a constant exchange of information that can be targeted.
## Client Side Technologies
- Technologies that are used to handle data for clients, and are vulnerable to manipulation
- HTML = Used to present data on web pages
- CSS = Used to design the way data appears on web pages
- JavaScript = Used to program logic and enhance user interaction
- JS Frameworks = Provide pre-programmed, ready-to-use features
## Server Side Technologies
- Used for server side programming or control, server side code is not visible to clients who request web pages
- PHP = Common, easy-to-use C based scripting language
- ASP = Microsoft's less common language, based on .NET
- SQL = Data structure handling language, used for databases.
- CGI = enables direct execution of commands on servers
- JSP = implements sub-applications, kown as servlets
## Web Servers
- Apache = the most commonly used HTTP server, that features a high level of scalability and modularity
- Nginx = Designed for maximum efficiency, using a minimum of resources
- IIS = commonly used for windows servers, but includes a less extensive set of features
## Apache2 Service
- available in most linux distributions
- installed by running apt install apache2
- by default, listens on port 80
- can be fully customized
    - apache configuration files are located at /etc/apache2/.
## Starting Apache

## HTTP Request Methods
- Http clients communicate w/ HTTP servers using request methods
- GET method is used to request data
- POST method is used to send information
## Request Method Identification
- There are several request methods.
- Nmap's http-methods script helps identify them
- it retrieves which HTTP methods the server supports
## Additional Request Methods
- HEAD = Requests information, w/o the body of the request
- DELETE = Used to delete a resource in a web page
- PUT = replaces a resource w/ a provided payload
- PATCH = Similar to PUT, but performs partial modification
- TRACE = Used for message loopback testing and debugging
- CONNECT = used for stateful connection ( web socket )
- OPTIONS = Requests communication options from the server
## HTTP Headers
- Used to include additional information
- can be enabled using a2enmod
- custom HTTP headers can be added
## Enable Headers
- Enabling HTTP header functionality
- Headers cannot be used until they are enabled
- Headers are modified using /etc/apache2/conf-available/security.conf
## Security Headers
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-PROTECTION
- STRICT-TRANSPORT-SECURITY
- X-CONTENT-TYPE-OPTIONS
    - Security headers used to defend against HTTP server attacks.
## Certification
- Digitally signed documents
- Provide authoritative identifcation
- Signed by a trusted certification authority
- Verified by the authorit's public key
# Burp Suite
## Traffic Interception Tools
- Burp suite = web proxy written in java, used for web application security testing.
- Fiddler = web debugging proxy that enables HTTP traffic examination for development
    - OWASP Zap = combined Zap's pen testing project w/ OWASP projects for a complete solution
## Burpe Suite Overview
- The dashboard of the burp suite tool is shown on the right
- provides multiple tools for security testing.
- works w/ add-ons that enhance its powerful tool set.
## Burp Suite Tools
- Repeater = repeatedly sends packets and tracks changes in responses, used to observe server reactions
- Intruder = Brute-froce module, sends parameters and manipulates them
- Sequencer = Sends a payload and examines the randomness of the request
- Decoder = Performs conversion of various data types
- Comparer = comparison data within burp, w/ other data
## Burpe Suite Proxy
- Burp starts a listening proxy on 127.0.0.1:8080
- the web browser must be configured to use the proxy
- by default, only outgoing requests are intercepted.
## Burp Suite History
- Network traffic can be seen in HTTP history records
- the traffic can be examined by clicking on the records
- viewing all sent data requires a browser to have the appropriate certificate.
## Burp Suite Interception
- the primary burp suite feature is traffic manipulation
- interception os turned on by default and packets are delayed
- the next step can be ewditing, forwarding, or dropping the traffic
## Burp Suite Repeater
- the reapter resends data to the server
- it can be used to manipulate captured data dn then send it on the server
- highly effective when testing client-server transactions
## Burp Suite Intruder
- Performs Brute-Force using various paylaods
- Captured parameters canbe marked for substituation
- a payload is selected for the substitution
## Burp Suite Sequencer
- Sequencer performs tests for randomness of values
- non-random values can simply be guessed or faked
- performs multiple tests to determine unique bit orders
