# Introduction to Databases
## Databases Types
- Relational databases = composed of multiple tables w/ predefined columns and rows
- Non-relational databases = Sometimes referred to as NoSQL databases; represents a newer method of storing
    - Relational databases are still the most common in use
## Relational Databases
- MySQL
- Oracle
- PostgreSQL
- MariaDB
## Non-Relational Databases
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Elasticsearch
- Cassandra
## Database Access
- Accessing a database requires running the MySQL service
- To start the service: service mysql start

- to connect to the database: mysql -u [user ] -p
- then, enter the password
## Creating Databases
- To create a DB: CREATE DATABASE [ name ];
- to interact w/ a DB: USE [name ]; or [database ].[table ]
- to view existing databases: = SHOW DATABASES;
## Creating Tables
- the base query is: CREATE TABLE [name ] ([column definitions]);
- each column is defined by: [name] [type] [paraeters];
- Display table structure: DESCRIBE [table];
## Common Data Types
- MySQL allows multiple data types to be stored in tables
- the following are some common types
- BOOLEAN = Represents a true/false-type value
- INT = Integer (number) data type
- FLOAT = Floating-point data type
- DATETIME = date-time combination data type
- VARCHAR = String data type
- BLOB = data type for large binary data (file)
## Inserting Data in a Table
- To add new data: INSERT INTO [table] (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...)
- To display all information in a table: SELECT * FROM [table];
## SELECT Statement
1. SELECT = from which columns should data be returned?
2. FROM = FROM which table should columns be returned?
3. WHERE = Condition
4. OR/LIKE = Additional logic filters
    - the SELECT statement can be used to obtain data from a table.
## Ordering Data
- ORDER BY, orders the data accoridng to a parameter
- to reorder all the information in the table = SELECT*FROM [table] ORDER BY [ column];
## UNION SELECT
- SQL allows combination of multiple queries
- SELECT commands can be aggregated
- Several SELECT statements can be combined: [table] UNION SELECT [ values];
## Information Functions
- SQL can include functions that provide additional details about the database
- Function     Usage
- VERSION() = Returns the SQL version
- DATABASE() = returns the database name
- USER() = returns the current user
- CONNECTION_ID() = Returns the connection ID
# SQL Injection
## SQL Injection Attack
- Injects SQL code
- Manipulates SQL queries
- Allows database enumeration
- Bypasses authentication
## SQLi Types
- In-Band (Classic) = Based on errors and union access to data in the DB, which an attacker injects w/ crafted SQL queries
- Inferential SQLi (Blind) = More challenging to perform than in-band; it can be error-, boolean-, or time-based injection w/ no visible output
- Out-of-Band = Due to lack of security parameters; uses a similar attack vector to inferential attacks
## Login Bypass
1. a query from a login page
2. User has control over the injected colored text
3. '__' means commented, causing SQL to ignore what follows
4. Allows login bypass
    - 1=1 evaluates to true as both an equation and a code statement
## Enumeration Vectors
- Version = Obtained by using the version() function
- Users = Enumerates user information
- Structure = Database structure is enumerated using information_schema
## SQLi Attack Flow
1. Cause an error by using '
2. Study the error
3. Modify the query using -- -
4. Inject the customized query
5. Enumeration is achieved
## SQLi Automation
- SQLMAP is an SQLi automation tool for database enumeration
- Detects and evades WAF's
- Can be configured to work through proxies
    - SQLMAP can be used w/ flags for specific injections, --dbs, --tables, --T [table], --columns, --dump
