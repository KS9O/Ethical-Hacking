# On-Path
- Whats a on-path attack?
- Man-in-the-Middle attacks are based on eavesdropping on communication
- used to obtain information secretly
- allows control over network traffic
## On-Path Positioning
- Wireless networks automatically allow on-path positions w/ various attack vectors
- LANs require physical connections to view network traffic
## Execution Steps
1. An attacking machine places itself between computers communicationg with each other
2. Victim have no idea their communication is being intercepted
3. Potentially sensitive information about a client is collected as the communication continues
# ARP Posioning 
## ADress Resolution Protocol
- ARP resolves IP addresses to MAC
- Layer 2 protocol in LANs
- Used in broadcast communication
- Resolves information saved in ARP tables
## ARP Table
-  the command arp -a is used in widnows machine to display the ARP table
## ARP Poisoning Process
- Exploits lack of ARP packet validation 
- Forges ARP request packets
- Requests are sent as if by the victim
- Updates ARP tables in the network's nodes
## ARPspoof
- arpsoof is a tool used to execute an ARP poisoning attack
- a forged packet is sent numerous times on the network
- the victims ARP table is updated w/ the false entry
## Enable Forwarding
- echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
1. echo outputs a text value passed as an argument
2. 1 is the value
3. '>' passes the value to the path
4. /pro/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward is the file location
    - the command tells the computer to forward packets to the specified destination
## Arpspoof Command
- arpspoof -i [interface] -t [victim IP] [target IP] -r
- arpspoof command parameters:
- -i [interface] - specifies the NIC
- -t [victim IP] - IP of the poisoned computer [target IP] - impersonated IP
- -r - allows bidirectional data flow (optional)
# DNS Poisoning
## DNS Poisoning Process
- Use ARP poisoning to pisiton the machine in the middle
- configure host files
- capture victims DNS request
- Redirect the victim to a target IP
## Hosts File
- Exists in every computer, it contains records of domain names and IP addresses
- used to resolve domain names to IP addresses

## Bettercap
- a tool used for On-Path attacks
- can initiate ARP poisoning and DNS spoofing
- sends false DNS responses to the bictim
## Bettercap Poisoning
- ![Alt text](<../assets/bettercap ARP poisoning command.png>)

- Bettercap ARP command parameters:
- set = specifies the required parameters
- arp.spoof.target = specifies the target IP
- arp.spoof = specifies ARP spoofing actions

## Bettercap DNS Poisoning
![Alt text](<../assets/Bettercap DNS Poisoning command.png>)

- Bettercap DNS command parameters:
- set = specifies required parameters
- dns.spoof.domains = specifies website domains to be spoofed
- dns.spoof.address = specifies IP addresses for redirection

## DNS Poisoning Results

# Port Stealing
## What is port stealing?
- populating the forwarding table
- using victims MAC address
- **works only in LANs**
- can cause delay or packet loss
## Port Stealing Process
- May be executed when ARP poisoning does not work
- It floods the switch w/ layer 2 packets
- packets are destined for the attacker, and originate in the victims machine.

# SSL Stripping
## What is SSL Stripping?
- Almost all websites use HTTPS
- Data is sent w/ TLS encryption
- SSL stripping downgrades HTTPS to HTTP
- providing plain text view of the data
## SSL Stripping Process
- the client contacts the web server w/ a HTTP request, 
- the server redirects the client to HTTPS and creates the session, 
- the attacker interrupts the redirection
![Alt text](<../assets/SSL Stripping process.png>)
- The attack should be executing using forwarding, while the attacker is the On-Path.
- Port redirection should be used to redirct away from 80
- the sslstrip tool is used to strip the encryption
![Alt text](<../assets/sslstrip tool.png>)
## iptables Command
- iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
1. iptables = enables linux firewall capabilties
2. -t nat = manipulates the NAT table
3. -A PREROUTING = appends data to a pre-routing chain
4. -p tcp = protocol type
5. --destination-port 80 = the accessed port
6. -j REDIRECT = action
7. --to-port 8080 = target port
    - the command redirects data from port 80 to port 8080
## sslstrip command
- sslstrip -l 8080
1. sslstrip = activates the tool
2. -l 8080 = the port to listen to
    - the command activates the sslstrip tool to listen on port 8080.
## SSL Strip Results

## SSL Strip Process
- the left panel in the example shows the results of a strip request
- the right panel shows a regular HTTPS request
- HSTS should be used to defend against SSL stripping
