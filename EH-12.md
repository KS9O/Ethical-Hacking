# Automated Scanning
## Vulnerability Assessment
- Manual Scans = Performed by PT experts to find complicated vulnerabilities
- Automated Scans = Performed to locate simple and more obvious bugs
    - **It is recommended that you combine automated scans w/ occasional, dedicated manual scans.**
## Automated Scanning
- Used by expert penetration testers
- enables detection of small, repetitive details
- automated vulnerability scanners are NOT replacements for manual testing
## Automated Scanning Types
- Passive = Scanning is done by using a proxy that inspects pages to which the user navigates
- Active = Scanning tries to investigate a page using the fuzzing technique
    - It is best practice to use both

# PT Report Subjects
## Writing a Report
- Summary of findings
- Extensive, detailed documentation
- Security-level assessment
- Suggestions for solutions
    - a good report contains both findings and solutions.
## Report types
- Executive Report = Contains only general details about the audit and the main points of the findings
- Detailed Report = Contains all possible details, including an extensive explanation of the vulnerability
    - a good PT report should be a combination of the two types.
## Report Sections
1. Introduction
2. Executive Summary
3. Findings
4. Appendices
## Executive Summary
