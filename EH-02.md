# Network Scanning Defintion
## Network Scanning
- A crucial reconnaissance step
- Mapping the network structure
- Collecting crucial information about a network
- Identifying devices on the network
    - Gathering as much as possible intelligence is essential to identify vulnerabilties and weaponize accordingly.
## Scan Discovery Benefits
- Services
- Hosts 
- Fingerprints 
- Open Ports
    - By scanning a network, an attacker can identify its structure and vulnerabilities.
# Nmap Overview
## Nmap Tool
- Network Mapper
- Flexible scanning tool
- Can monitor host or service uptime
- Uses raw IP packets
- Can use scripts.
    - A free open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing
## Nmap
- Used to craft network packets
- Can be used to scan entire networks
- Different scans reveal different types of network-related information
## TCP Flags
- It is important to understand TCP flags for a better understanding of how NMAP works
- Flag = Explanation
- SYN = Starts synchronization for a new connection
- ACK = Acknowledges data reception
- PSH = Instructs to send the buffered data.
- URG = Indicates an urgent packet that needs to be processed immediately
- RST = Disconnects upon an error
- FIN = Marks the end of communication
# Nmap Scanning Types
## Scan Types
- Half Open
- Connect
- FIN Scan
- UDP Scan
    - Note that these are not the only Nmap methods that perform scans. Nmap includes other scan types aswell.
## Command Flags
- $ nmap [ flag ] [ param] [ IP address ]
1. 
2. -p Scan for specific ports
3. -6 - enable IPV6 scan
4. -O - enable OS detection
5. -sU - UDP port scan
6. -Pn - Don't check if the host is up via ping
7. -sS Enable 'stealth' scan
    - In the case of a SYN request, if the answer is RST, the host is up but the port is closed. If the port is open, the answer will be SYN-ACK.
## Fingerprinting
- Nmap can perform fingerprinting to detect services.
- Uses the same scanning types as those mentioned previously.
## Nmap Fingerprinting
- Nmap can identify specific versions
- It can intercept and analyze special crafted objects to expose informati0n about a service.
- Nmap can also perform OS detection
## Filtered Ports
- If a conclusive answer cannot be determined, it will be considered filtered
- IF there is no response from a port, it will be considered filtered.
## Firewall & IDS Evasion
- Proxies
- Timing = -T flag
- Fragmentation = -f flag
- Decoys = -D flag
    - Nmap has other functionalities that can help attackers bypass firewalls and IDS.
## Nmap Scriptiing Engine
- Powerful and flexible features
- can work w/ automatiion
- Uses scripts execute scans
- Located at /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
## NSE Utilization
- NSE web server enumeration
- Scripts can be run using: --script < filename / category >
- Nmap --sccript-help < name of the script > provides information to help use a script properly.

## Script Run Control
- Prerule
- Hostrule
- Portrule
- Postrule
    - Rules that determine when a script will run are defined in the script's file
# Additional Tools
## Netdiscover Overview
- Uses the address resolution protocol
- dedciated to networks w/o DHCP
- Sends ARP requests over the network
- Sniffs ARP replies
 ## Netdiscover
 - Netdiscover displays sniffed IP and MAC addresses
 - It starts an active ARP scan to identify live hosts
 - It can also identify the host vendor by analyzing the MAC address
## Masscan Overview
- Internet scale scans
- can send 10 million packets per second
- Use asynchronous transmission
- Considered a less reliable scanner
## Masscan
- Masscan performs large scale scans on thousands of IPs in seconds
- Mainly used for macro scans of large networks
## Zenmap Overview
- Nmap's GUI version
- Has the same functionality as Nmap
- Easy to use for beginners
- Scans can be saved as profiles for reuse
## Zenmap
- Zenmap has several preconfigured scan options
- it enables creation of customized profile scans
- it features visualizations presentations of topologies and host details
