# Client-side Web Languages
## Javascript
- JS code can be added to HTML pagesa
- it can affect the pages behavior
- It can manage communication
- It can handle events
## JS in HTML Pages
- Event Handlers = JS events such as onclick can be applied in HTML tags
- Script Tags = JS typically is defined using < script > tags
- External Files = JavaScript can be imported via external files
# Cross-Site Scripting
## XSS Overview
- Xss is a client-side attack
- It can affect other users by storing the code
- It exploits vulnerability in web applications
- It allows the injection of malicious scripts
## XSS Types
- Reflected XSS = a payload is sent to a server, which then sends a response based on the payload's content
- Stored XSS = a payload is stored on the server and affects all users working w/ the server
- DOM XSS = a payload executes locally by corrupting the document object model
## Reflected XSS
- a website with a user input interface
- a request is sent to the server to process
- the result is returned after processing due to lack of protection
## Stored XSS
- the payload is saved in the database
- Every user who views the list is affected
- Can be implemented on websites w/ comments and chats
## DOM XSS
- Websites print information from their URLs
- Even though there is no user input, the DOM can be leveraged for the attack
- For the DOM to affect other users, the URL must be sent to them
## Cookies
- Cookie Value = a string of letters or numbers that verify, track, and store user information
- Cookie Theft = An XSS attack can acquire a cookie to steal a session
## XSS Consequences
- Defacing
- Cookie Theft
- Clickjacking
- Trojan Delivery
# Session Hijacking
## Importing jQuery
![Alt text](<../assets/importing jquery.png>)
    - the command imports jquery
    - a java script library
    - enables simple code usage
    - imported using google cdn
- The command imports a library named jquery that contains useful functions, these functions can perform custom requests
## Steal the Cookie
![Alt text](<../assets/steal the cookie.png>)
- $.ajax() = allows asynchronous communication
- URL = whom to communicate with
- type = The HTTP method
- Data = the information that is sent
    - the command retrieves the targets cookie and sends it to another address using Ajax
# XSS Mitigations
## Means of protection
- Regex = typically used in programming to provide search patterns
- htmlspecialcahrs = sterilizes data and replaces dangerous characters such as <
- htmllentities = sterilizes data using safe alternatives instead of dangerous characters
## Htmlentities

# Local File Inclusion
## LFI Overview
- common in PHP-based websites
- leverages the option to include code
- uses the include() function
- allows the display of sensitive files and data
## RFI Overview
- Remote file inclusion ( RFI) is similar to LFI
- Accesses remote servers to deliever files
- lacks remote file validation
## LFI and RFI Vulnerabilities
- the include() function allows using data from other PHP files
- can be leveraged for malicious purposes
