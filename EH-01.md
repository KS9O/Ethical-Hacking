3. Cyber Attack Cycle
# Hackers
- Altering the functionality or behavior of a system
- Taking advantage of a system
- Done by both attackers and defenders
    - Security professionals must always remain up to date regarding hacking methods.
## Hacker Types
- White Hats = Ethical hackers who are experts in compromising computer security systems with the aim of protecting them
- Black Hats = Hackers who violate ethical cybersecurity codes for malicious purposes
- Gray hats = Hackers who fall somewhere between white and blacks
## Hacker Teams
- Red Team = Security experts and professionals who are recognized as penetration testers
- Blue Team = Mainly involved in monitoring, investigating, and analyzing systems to protect them
- Purple Team = Hackers who try to combine the methods and advantages of red teams and blue teams.
## Live Attack Map: Check Point
- Hacking attempts occur all the time, all over the world.
- Hacking skills are often used maliciously to perform cybercrimes.
- Check Points live cyber threat map displays attacks currently being launched around the world.
## Live Attack Map: Fortinet
- Similar to check points map, the fortinet map displays live attacks that are launched around the world.
## Ethics: Penetration Testers
- Principle = must follow a code of ethics
- Ethics = use legal means
- Integrity = Sign non-disclosure agreements
- Legal Awareness = consider clients local laws
- Professionalism = have ethical and professional integrity
- Responsibilities = do not take part in any malicious activity.
- Reliability = Access only permitted systems.
# Malware
## Malware Definition 
- Malicious software
- Created to inflict damage
- Created to steal information
- Exists in various forms
## Malware Types
- Virus 
- Ransomware
- Trojan Horse
- Worm 
- Botnet
# Cyberattack Cycle
## Common Attack Flow
1. Reconnaissance = Scan an organization for vulnerabilities.
2. Weaponization = Generate a payload
3. Deliver the payload
4. Exploit & Execute = Run commands upon execution
5. Command & Control = Possible full system access
## Attack Terminology
- Vulnerability
- Payload
- Exploit
- Malware
- Backdoor
## Significant Attacks in Recent Years
- Stuxnet is a worm that was designed to damage the progress of Iran's nuclear program
- Sony's Playstation network was attacked by a simple database attack (SQLi)
- WannaCry distribution locked approximately 230,000 computers
## Unique Zero-Day Vulnerability
- Newly discovered vulnerability
- Unknown to others
- Exploitable until mitigated
- Can lead to debastating damage
## WannaCry Attack Chain
- The EternalBlue exploit used by wannaCry, exploits a vulnerability in the SMB service.
- When wannaCry was executed, it tried toconnect w/ the attacker's C&C
- When executed, WannaCry encrypted personal files and sent pop-up messages.
## Kali OS
- Linux Debian-based OS distribution, specifically made from advanced PT ( penetration Testing)
- Includes many tools for penetration testers
    - Kali 2019.3 ( Used in labs) provides better support for various tools than newer distributions.
